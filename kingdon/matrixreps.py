    This represents any GA expression as a matrix. To illustrate by example, we might want to
    represent the multivector equation y = R >> x as a matrix equation y = Ax.
    (If the multivector `x` is of pure grade, the matrix `A` will be in irrep of the transformation.)
    To obtain A, call this function as follows::

        alg = Algebra(3, 0, 1)
        R = alg.evenmv(name='R')
        x = alg.vector(name='x')
        A, y = expr_as_matrix(lambda R, x: R >> x, R, x)

    In order to build the matrix rep the input `expr` is evaluated, so make sure the inputs
    to the expression are given in the correct order.
    The last of the positional arguments is assumed to be the vector x in the linear equation y = Ax,
    and is *assumed to be symbolic*.
    The other arguments can also be numeric or e.g. a multidimensional array/torsor, in which case the
    returned matrix A will be numerical as well. This can e.g. be used to easily generate the matrix
    representations of a given (dual-)quaternion::

        >>> alg = Algebra(3, 0, 1)
        >>> R = alg.evenmv(e12=0.25*numpy.pi).exp()
        >>> x = alg.vector(name='x')
        >>> A, y = expr_as_matrix(lambda R, x: R >> x, R, x)
        >>> A
        [[ 1.  0.  0.  0.]
         [ 0.  0.  1.  0.]
         [ 0. -1.  0.  0.]
         [ 0.  0.  0.  1.]]

    :expr: Callable representing a valid GA expression.
        Can also be a :class:`~kingdon.operator_dict.OperatorDict`.
    :inputs: All positional arguments are consider symbolic input arguments to `expr`. The last of these is assumed to
        represent the vector `x` in `y = Ax`.
    :res_like: (optional) multivector corresponding to the desired output. If None, then the full output is returned.
        However, if only a subsegment of the output is desired, provide a multivector with the desired shape.
        In the example above setting, `res_like = alg.vector(e1=1)` would mean only the e1 component of the matrix
        is returned. This does not have to be a symbolic multivector, only the keys are checked.
    :return: This function returns the matrix representation, and the result of applying the expression to the input.
        If at least one of the inputs other than the last one is symbolic, the result will be a sympy symbolic matrix.
        Otherwise, the result will be a numpy array.
