Features
--------

Kingdon is a Geometric Algebra (GA) library which combines a Pythonic API with
symbolic simplification and just-in-time compilation to achieve high-performance in a single package.
It support both symbolic and numerical GA computations.
Moreover, :code:`kingdon` uses :code:`ganja.js` for visualization in notebooks,
making it an extremely well rounded GA package.

In bullet points:

- Symbolically optimized.
- Leverage sparseness of input.
- :code:`ganja.js` enabled graphics in jupyter notebooks.
- Agnostic to the input types: work with GA's over :code:`numpy` arrays, :code:`PyTorch` tensors, :code:`sympy` expressions, etc. Any object that overloads addition, subtraction and multiplication makes for valid multivector coefficients in :code:`kingdon`.
- Automatic broadcasting, such that transformations can be applied to e.g. point-clouds.
- Compatible with :code:`numba` and other JIT compilers to speed-up numerical computations.

Code Example
------------
In order to demonstrate the power of :code:`Kingdon`, let us first consider the common use-case of the
commutator product between a bivector and vector.

In order to create an algebra, use :code:`Algebra`. When calling :code:`Algebra` we must provide the signature of the
algebra, in this case we shall go for 3DPGA, which is the algebra :math:`\mathbb{R}_{3,0,1}`.
There are a number of ways to make elements of the algebra. It can be convenient to work with the basis blades directly.
We can add them to the local namespace by calling :code:`locals().update(alg.blades)`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from kingdon import Algebra
    >>> alg = Algebra(3, 0, 1)
    >>> locals().update(alg.blades)
    >>> b = 2 * e12
    >>> v = 3 * e1
    >>> b * v
    -6 𝐞₂

This example shows that only the :code:`e2` coefficient is calculated, despite the fact that there are
6 bivector and 4 vector coefficients in 3DPGA. But by exploiting the sparseness of the input and by performing symbolic
optimization, :code:`kingdon` knows that in this case only :code:`e2` can be non-zero.

Symbolic usage
--------------
If only a name is provided for a multivector, :code:`kingdon` will automatically populate all
relevant fields with symbols. This allows us to easily perform symbolic computations.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from kingdon import Algebra
    >>> alg = Algebra(3, 0, 1)
    >>> b = alg.bivector(name='b')
    >>> b
    b01 𝐞₀₁ + b02 𝐞₀₂ + b03 𝐞₀₃ + b12 𝐞₁₂ + b13 𝐞₁₃ + b23 𝐞₂₃
    >>> v = alg.vector(name='v')
    >>> v
    v0 𝐞₀ + v1 𝐞₁ + v2 𝐞₂ + v3 𝐞₃
    >>> b.cp(v)
    (b01*v1 + b02*v2 + b03*v3) 𝐞₀ + (b12*v2 + b13*v3) 𝐞₁ + (-b12*v1 + b23*v3) 𝐞₂ + (-b13*v1 - b23*v2) 𝐞₃

It is also possible to define some coefficients to be symbolic by inputting a string, while others can be numeric:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from kingdon import Algebra, symbols
    >>> alg = Algebra(3, 0, 1)
    >>> b = alg.bivector(e12='b12', e03=3)
    >>> b
    3 𝐞₀₃ + b12 𝐞₁₂
    >>> v = alg.vector(e1=1, e3=1)
    >>> v
    1 𝐞₁ + 1 𝐞₃
    >>> w = b.cp(v)
    >>> w
    3 𝐞₀ + (-b12) 𝐞₂


A :code:`kingdon` MultiVector with symbols is callable. So in order to evaluate :code:`w` from the previous example,
for a specific value of :code:`b12`, simply call :code:`w`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> w(b12=10)
    3 𝐞₀ + -10 𝐞₂
